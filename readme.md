# Welcome to Space Terrains! 游놓游놓游놓游놓游놓


Thanks for checking my Space Terrains game.


## About
This was my first game  with moving elements, ever made! After watching a few different tutorials on making browser game, I decided to make my take on Space Invadors meets Flappy Bird!

## Features

<h3> At the moment:</h3>
<ul>
<li> It works!
 <li> Player is able to move the spaceship to left,right up and down
<li> Terrains are generating randomly on the left or right size
<li> Terrains are moving and deleting themselves when bottom is reached
<li> Game is finishes when the spaceship touches terrain
<li> Score is being updated while playing
<li> Still working on this, but the start page should show the highest score (saved in local memory)
</ul>

## In the future

<li> I'd love to add some kind of shooting mechanism 
<li> Some kind of buff system can be created
<li> Making design resposinve and usable on mobile?
